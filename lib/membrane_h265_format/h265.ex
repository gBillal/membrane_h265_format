  `:au` means each buffer contains one Access Unit - all the NAL units required to decode

  NALUs required for one frame are in different buffers

  When alignment is set to `:au`, determines whether buffers have NALu info attached in metadata.

  If true, each buffer contains the NAL units list under `metadata.h265.nalus`. The list consists of
  maps with the following entries:
  - `prefixed_poslen: {pos, len}` - position and length of the NALu within the payload
  - `unprefixed_poslen: {pos, len}` - as above, but omits Annex B prefix
  - `metadata: metadata` - metadata that would be merged into the buffer metadata

  Regardless of the `alignment` value, NAL units are always in the Annex B format.

  In Annex B [defined in ITU-T H.265 Recommendation](http://itu.int/itu-t/recommendations/rec.aspx?rec=14660&lang=en)
  each NAL unit is preceded by three or four-byte start code (`0x(00)000001`)
  that helps to identify boundaries.
  Annex B is suitable for writing to a file or streaming with MPEG-TS.
